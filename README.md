# HotelApp

This is a simple hotel app that allows you to search for hotels and book them. It is built with C# / .NET 7 using ASP.NET Core Razor Pages for Web UI and WPF for Desktop UI.
For data access it uses Dapper with SQL Server and Stored Procedures. I added culture support for several languages in Web UI as an experiment.
